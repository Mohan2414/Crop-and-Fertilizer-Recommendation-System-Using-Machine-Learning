🚜 Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System Using Machine Learning 🌱

I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on that aims to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions for better crop selection and fertilizer application!

This project leverages machine learning models to provide optimal recommendations based on soil and climate conditions. The system uses three key datasets to drive recommendations:

🌾 Fertilizer Prediction Data (Fertilizer Prediction.csv)

 This dataset helps suggest the best fertilizer types based on parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, and humidity.

🌱 Crop Recommendation Data (Crop_recommendation.csv)

 This dataset helps recommend the most suitable crops based on the levels of soil nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as the climatic conditions.

🌧️ Rainfall Data (rainfall.csv)

 The rainfall data helps tailor crop recommendations by providing monthly rainfall details for various regions, allowing for better decisions based on local climate conditions.

✨ The system’s main features include:

🌱 Crop Recommendation: Suggests the best crop based on user-inputted soil and climatic data.

 🧪 Fertilizer Suggestion: Recommends the optimal fertilizer based on the crop type and soil characteristics.

 📊 Data-Driven Insights: Uses AI models to help farmers improve productivity and make better-informed decisions.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

🔹 Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib for data processing and visualization

 🔹 Streamlit for creating an interactive web app

 🔹 Machine learning algorithms for recommendation and prediction
